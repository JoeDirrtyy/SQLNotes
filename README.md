SQL Notes

What is a Database?
-a database is a collection of data, typically stored electronically in a computer system
-A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS)
-Databases are usually modeled with rows and columns and can be manipulayed and organized
-SQL stands for structured query language
-SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to manipulate data and provide control
-The difference between a datbase and a speadsheet like and excell spread sheet is how the dat is stored
who can access the data, and how much data can be stored
-Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, while SQLdatabases are designed to hold much more information,
and allow multiple users to access at the same time using complex logic and langauge

Types of data bases:

-Relational:Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. they provide the most efficient way to access information

-Object-oriented:Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.

-Distributed databases:consists of two or more files located in different sites, the database maybe be stored on multiple computers accross different networks

-Data warehouses:A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.

-NoSQL databases:allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated 

-Graph databases:Stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.

-OLTP database:a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.

-Open source:An open source database system is one whose source code is open source

-Cloud:a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform, there are 2 types of cloud, traditional, and database as a service (DBaaS)

-Multimodel:ombine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end

-Document/JSON:Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information in A JSON format

-Self-driving:cloud-based and use machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by database administrators.


Database Software
-Datsbase software is used to create, edit, and maintain database files and records
-The software handles data storage, backup, reporting, and multi access control

DBMS Database managment system
-A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs
-facilitates oversight and control of databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations

MYSQL Database
-MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL
-it was designed for web applications and can run on any platform
-MYSQL can process millions of queries and thousands of transactions
